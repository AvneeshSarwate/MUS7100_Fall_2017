## Research Question
How can coders and non-coders have equitable control of a performance?

## Hypothesis
By giving instrumentalists ancillary control interfaces for contributing higher-level structure into the performance system.

## Research
We are prototyping interfaces to explore application of our hypothesis.

## Interface 1 - Response Functions
An instrumentalist cycles between various response functions whose parameters are live-coded.
We will explore two methods of triggering these response functions:
- Continuous Application: The function is continuously applied to the instrumentalist's input.
- Hold-based triggering: The function is applied only when the instrumentalist holds any chord for a live coded amount of time.
