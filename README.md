# MUSI 7100 Fall 2017
## Research Question
How can coders and non-coders have equitable control of a performance?

## Hypothesis
By giving instrumentalists ancillary control interfaces for contributing higher-level structure into the performance system.

## Research
We are prototyping interfaces to explore application of our hypothesis.

## Interface 1 - Response Functions
An instrumentalist cycles between various response functions whose parameters are live-coded.
We will explore two methods of triggering these response functions:
- Continuous Application: The function is continuously applied to the instrumentalist's input.
- Hold-based triggering: The function is applied only when the instrumentalist holds any chord for a live coded amount of time.

## Interface 2 - Collaborative Loop Sequencing
An instrumentalist records loops into buffers on a Launchpad. Another launchpad then serves as a canvas for sequencing these loops. The live coder then can algorithmically control the sequence grid, as well as coding tempo and loop length. The live coder can also code transforms for the loop banks that instrumentalists can record into.
