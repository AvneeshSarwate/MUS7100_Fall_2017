The strengths of such a system are that both live coder and non coder can manipulate the same \"world\" in different ways, but not having enough stuff to manipulate forces them to start manipulating the same things at the same time to stay engaged, and then they start stepping on each others toes and have to start reacting to each other at a very short time scale, which can be difficult. \n",

However, one ball is heavier than the rest and the center of the system (each ball corresponds to a note, and a ball/wall colision plays that note). The live-coder can not only play with the physics parameters of the system, but can remap what note corresponds to what ball (musical semantics). In particular, changing what note is mapped to the central ball can effectively change the tonality of the music being generated. \n",
